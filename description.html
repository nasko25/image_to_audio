					<h1> &emsp; How to make sure you get the best possible results </h1>
					<br>
					<ol>
						<li> Make sure that you use the best possible camera. </li>
						<br> <p> &emsp; This may sound obvious, but it is imperative that you upload the highest resolution image that you can take. </p>

						<li> When taking an image of text, try to not warp the text. </li>
						<br> <p> &emsp; It is really important that the photo you upload for processing looks more like this <img class = "desc_img" src = "images/description/IMG_8404.jpg" alt="not warped example" height = "500"></p>
						<br> <p> &emsp; Than like this: <img class = "desc_img rotate" src = "images/description/IMG_8403.jpg" alt="not warped example" width = "500"> </p>
						<br> <p> &emsp; If for some reason you cannot do anything to avoid text warping, you can select the <span style = "color: #007bff;">"bad photo"</span> button
						and the engine will try to fix your photo for you. But it would work best, if you take a photo without text warping in it.
						<br> &emsp; Keep in mind that the second photo is too warped and no type of processing is going to help it.
						</p>

						<li> Crop the image so that there is only text you want to convert to audio. </li>
						<br> <p> &emsp; Make sure your image looks more like this: </p> <img class = "desc_img" src = "images/description/IMG_8407.jpg" alt = "well-cropped image example" height = "500">
						<br> <p> &emsp; Than like this: </p> <img class = "desc_img" src = "images/description/IMG_8404.jpg" alt = "not well-cropped image example" height = "500">

						<li> If the text is warped, or there are dark spots in the photo (like in the example above), use the <span style = "color: #007bff;">"bad photo"</span> button. </li>
						<br> <p> &emsp; If the text in your photo is warped even a little, like in the beginning of this example image: </p> <img class = "desc_img" src = "images/description/IMG_8521.jpg" alt = "image with warped text example" height = "500">

						<li> Finally, this is an example of a photo that does not require the <span style = "color: #007bff;">"bad photo"</span> option: </li>
						<br> <img class = "desc_img" src = "images/description/IMG_8523.jpg" alt = "not well-cropped image example" height = "500">
